% You can use the \LaTeX's \texttt{marginpar} command to insert figures in the (left) margin side of the document (see \autoref{fig:marginparsample}).

%Use a numbered list of references at the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by first author, and referenced by numbers in brackets \cite{Anderson92,Klemmer02,Mather00,Zellweger01}
%For papers from conference proceedings, include the title of the paper and an abbreviated name of the conference (e.g., for Interact 2003 proceedings, use Proc. Interact 2003). 
%Do not include the location of the conference or the exact date; do include the page numbers if available. 
%See the examples of citations at the end of this document. 

%Your references should be published materials accessible to the public.  
%Internal technical reports may be cited only if they are easily accessible (i.e., you provide the address for obtaining the report within your citation) and may be obtained by any reader for a nominal fee.  
%Proprietary information may not be cited. 
%Private communications should be acknowledged in the main text, not referenced  (e.g., [Robertson, personal communication]).





% The Executive Council of SIGCHI has committed to making SIGCHI conferences more inclusive for researchers, practitioners, and educators with disabilities. As a part of this goal, the all authors are asked to work on improving the accessibility of their submissions. Specifically, we encourage authors to carry out the following five steps:
% \begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Add alternative text to all figures
% 	\item Mark table headings
% 	\item Add tags to the PDF
% 	\item Verify the default language
% 	\item Set the tab order to ``Use Document Structure''
% \end{enumerate}
% Unfortunately good tools do not yet exist to create tagged PDF files from Latex. LaTeX users will need to carry out all of the above steps in the PDF directly using Adobe Acrobat, after the PDF has been generated.
