The 4 Effects of Supplementary Data

	* false pattern recognition - people see patterns in data
	* positive tendency - people use emotion to make decisions, data informs emotions
	* misuse of prior knowledge - people use information they have previously seen
	* specialisation - experts use tools and data differently to non-experts

	For each:
	1. Summarise the effect
	2. For each bias, summarise:
	   a) the bias and original observations
	   b) observations in clinical environments
	   c) potential effects
	3. Conclude by summarising each identified effect

PHC2020

* frameowrk for action
* data + tech improves 
	health, quality + reduce cost
	patient empowerment
	carer empoowerment
* in the uk, the rising demand for healthcare, amidst increasing financial constraint, is urging a move toward using technology to support healthier lives
* "give care professionals and carers access to all the data, infromation and knowledge they need - real-time digital information on a person's health"
* "The failure to use information properly in health and care means people can
experience unnecessary levels of preventable ill health" [6]
* By 2015 patients will be able to see their medical record online
* By 2018, it is proposed that patiens may write into their record, e.g. data from wearable devices
* accreditation of apps devices and services?
* 2016 - new knowledge and skills framework to train workers in data + tech
* code 4 health - train doctors in creating apps + digital services
