\begin{abstract}
While the \emph{Quantified Self} movement has largely centred around the individual’s own use of his or her data, the same kinds of patient-captured information about their well-being could, in theory, facilitate more accurate and effective medical diagnosis and treatment.  In practice, however, introducing such data during in a way that they can be used effectively and without additional risk during patient visits and hospital episodes creates significant challenges, that we believe, HCI research can help.  In this paper, we seek to understand the primary bottlenecks to the use of QS data during patient visits in both primary and secondar (specialist) care through a literature survey and group

\section{Introduction}

Empowering patients ``take charge'' of their health is an idea frequently championed by politicians, technologists, and healthcare experts alike~\cite{swan2012health}.  Yet, despite countless government and industry-led initiatives across Europe, the UK, and North America, to inspire this ``patient-led healthcare revolution'', it has yet to happen.  

One area, however, where individuals have been taking the lead in trying to understand their own health, is the \emph{Quantified Self} movement \cite{}, primarily comprised of hobbyists and non-health experts who use technological tools to meticulously record and interrogate the minutiae of their physical and mental states over time.   As the population of those interested in self-tracking grew and attracted mainstream interest, the industry has swiftly responded to the expanding demand for self-tracking tools and technologies with a now enormous collection of wearable and embeddable sensors.  These technologies now enable people to record and keep track of aspects of their health with less effort and better fidelity than ever previously, and will continue to improve such as by being less invasive, more comfortable, and more accurate.

While the direct application of such sensors to understanding patients' particular symptoms, situations and lifestyles in the healthcare context would seem straightforward, most physicians today avoid or outright reject the use of self-logged QS data. Even when this information is provided by patients and is reference, it is rarely, if ever used for differential diagnosis.  

What are the barriers to the use of self-logged QS data in critical clinical decision making settings?  What are doctors, nurses, specialists and medical professionals' views on the QS movement and self-logged data?  Is it a problem of what is being captured, how it is being captured, how it is represented, or presented?  In this paper, we summarise an initial exploration of these questions comprised of two stages: first, a literature survey pre-study, which informed the design of a set of role-playing probes with clinical specialists.

\section{Background} 

% a little bit about all the potential ways QS could help
The use of QS data in clincial practice has been proposed in at least three contexts; first, early onset detection of certain conditions for a wide range of conditions including depression, diabetes. By identifying various markers and changes in people's longitudinal activities, such techniques may be able to identify potential 

\section{Pre-study: Literature Review} 

\subsection{Method}
To identify relevant literature we performed a search using three methods using keywords "quantified self", "clinical decision-making" "hospital admission", "GP visit", directly on the BMJ, Google Scholar, Web of Knowledge, Springer Index, and the ACM DL.
