While the \emph{Quantified Self} movement has largely centred around the individual’s own use of his or her data, the same kinds of patient-captured information about their well-being could, in theory, facilitate more accurate and effective medical diagnosis and treatment.  In practice, however, introducing such data during in a way that they can be used effectively and without additional risk during patient visits and hospital episodes creates significant challenges, that we believe, HCI research can help.  In this paper, we seek to understand the primary bottlenecks to the use of QS data during patient visits in both primary and secondar (specialist) care through a literature survey and group

\section{Introduction}

Empowering patients ``take charge'' of their health is an idea frequently championed by politicians~\cite{brown, obama}, technologists~\cite{ihealth}, journalists~\cite{goetz} and healthcare experts alike~\cite{swan2012health}.  Yet, despite countless government and industry-led initiatives across Europe, the UK, and North America, to inspire this ``patient-led healthcare revolution'', it has yet to happen.  

One area, however, where individuals have been taking the lead in trying to understand their own health, is the \emph{Quantified Self} movement \cite{}, primarily comprised of hobbyists and non-health experts who use technological tools to meticulously record and interrogate the minutiae of their physical and mental states over time.   As the population of those interested in self-tracking grew and attracted mainstream interest, the industry has swiftly responded to the expanding demand for self-tracking tools and technologies with a now enormous collection of wearable and embeddable sensors.  These technologies now enable people to record and keep track of aspects of their health with less effort and better fidelity than ever previously, and will continue to improve such as by being less invasive, more comfortable, and more accurate.

While the direct application of such sensors to understanding patients' particular symptoms, situations and lifestyles in the healthcare context would seem straightforward, most physicians today avoid or outright reject the use of self-logged QS data. Even when this information is provided by patients and is reference, it is still rarely, if ever, used for differential diagnosis.  

What are the barriers to the use of self-logged QS data in critical clinical decision making settings?  This is a delicate question to approach for several reasons; first, during the a course of a single visit, there may be many kinds of decisions regarding a patient, made by a plurality of different kinds of medical professionals, in a plurality of different settings.   Paramedics in an ambulance, triage nurses within an emergency room, specialists in a acute care unit or hospital wards, to generap practitioners (GPs) in practice surgeries, all make decisions regarding a patient under distinct situational and informational constraints~\cite{croskerry}. Second, even if focus is centred around a single setting, by a single class of medical professionals, such as GP surgeries, there may be significant disparities in the ways different GPs do things; for example, the degree to which GPs use electronic medical records (EMRs)~\cite{hunt} to organise patient data, prescribe particular tests or treatments~\cite{}, or the mechanism and method that they use to maintain good patient relationships~\cite{} can be highly inconsistent. Finally, clinical decision making is a field that is not only long established, but one of the most specialised occupations in the modern workforce; therefore, understanding the effects of the introduction of any new information into such a setting requires an in-depth understanding of the processes, training and tradition.

This paper presents an 

%Second, medical decision-making is making  we wish to approach this question carefully, considering What are doctors, nurses, specialists and medical professionals' views on the QS movement and self-logged data?  Is it a problem of what is being captured, how it is being captured, how it is represented, or presented?  In this paper, we summarise an initial exploration of these questions comprised of two stages: first, a literature survey pre-study, which informed the design of a set of role-playing probes with clinical specialists.

Hypotheses :

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Relevance of \emph{what} is captured?
    \item Trusting the \emph{veracity/quality} of the instrument or capture method?
    \item Problems with \emph{access}?
    \item Interfere with patient visit \emph{workflow}?
    \item Danger of introduction of risk due to \emph{cognitive biases}?
    \item External factors? (\emph{data handling}, \emph{legal}, \emph{billing} etc)
\end{enumerate}

\section{Background} 

We contextualise our investigation of self-logged data in clinical decision-making against two closely related fields within the medical literature: the first, \emph{evidence based medicine} sought to expand the use of empirical methods (such as used in epidemiology) for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of decisions such as those affecting treatment choices.  The second, \emph{clinical decision making} examines the cognitive, interactional and situational processes which influence how practitioners arrive at decisions, under the practical constraints necessary for conducting their practices.  In this section, we first introduce at a high level, common visions of how technology-enabled, patient data-driven healthcare might be realised in the future.  We then discuss evidence-based medicine and the role of clinical decision making literature to our investigation.

\subsection{Visions for Data-driven eHealth / mHealth}
Notions of ``big data'' and ``data driven healthcare'' have inspired many visions  for more data-informed healthcare internationally. In the popular press, Thomas Goetz's \emph{The Decision Tree} outlined a vision in which every person will be DNA-tested at birth, and tracked with sensors throughout their lives; the resulting piles of data would be used to classify and compute (through statistical measures) optimal treatments and actions. Policy makers have set out national agendas towards such a goal; the UK's Personalised Health and Care 2020 framework set out a vision in which health and well-being data, sensed from wearable and environmental sensors, would seamlessly integrate with patient health records by 2018~\cite{Personalised2014}.  The framework proposes that these data would ``fill in the gaps'' between visits with their GP or specialist, enabling clinicians to more effectively perform personalised differential diagnosis at point of care.  It is anticipated that the introduction of such technologies will simultaneously improve outcomes substantially and drive down costs.  Other visions include use in preventative medicine, to enable early onset detection of chronic conditions, thereby potentially reversing the course of conditions before they set in~\cite{Swan2009}.  Exploratory data mining of sensed data is also likely to radically improve our understanding of both prominent and rare medical conditions, by revealing relationships among genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors that might contribute to patients' symptoms.  Initial enthusiasm for this vision is also evident in the US, with the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of  consumer tracking devices for clinical trials, citing the importance of quantifiable analysis of physical activity to physiological monitoring~\cite{U.S.FoodandDrugAdministration2014}.

% dont have much basis of saying this

Responding to this interest, the race to attract end-user consumers to better and more accurate physiological sensors has taken off past 8 years. New, freshly funded companies such as Withings, FitBit and Jawbone, have been joined veteran sport performance monitoring device makers such as Garmin, while established brands for sport to consumer electronics, such Nike and Sony have joined the fray to each develop attractive wearable personal tracking devices.  While still a minority, several, namely at the time of writing iHealth and Withings, have had several of their consumer-level sensors certified for clinical use, as under the US FDA Class-1 and 2 medical device classification scheme. 

%\section{Barriers to Adoption}

% Yet despite this industry, political and tech-driven enthusiasm for use of self-logged QS data, clinical uptake has been slow.  For example, even with Apple's partnership with US healthcare providers around the targeted of their HealthKit framework have focused primarily on its use in telemonitoring for randomised controlled trials (RCT) rather than for differential diagnosis.  But even here, problems have been met with some partners pulling out, citing insufficient interest by both patients and physicians~\cite{}.  

% An informal survey by VentureBeat found that clinicians were largely ''simply not interested in FitBit data'', assigning blame on several factors~\cite{venturebeat}. The first was time; doctors cited simply not having the time to look at data brought in by patients.  The second pertained ot access; electronic medical records simply did not admit or integrate patient-supplied data.  Third were concerns about data quality, e.g. that devices available today were simply not yet accurate enough for clinical use.  Finally, doctors expressed legal concerns around use of the data; citing the potential to be held liable for data captured by wearable health sensors.

\subsection{Evidence Based Medicine: Clinical Decision-Making with Data under Uncertainty} 

The term \emph{evidence-based medicine} refers to the use of epidemiological methods in both patient-level decision making and formulation of population-level clinical care guidelines.  In the first use of the term, David M. Eddy pointed out that, while outcome analysis may make it seem that there is a clear path towards achieving more accurate, or at least consistent, diagnoses, things are never that simple in practice~\cite{eddy1990challenge}:

\begin{quote}
  Decisions might be variable but they are not whimsical or flippant. The variability occurs because physicians must make decisions about phenomenally complex problems, under very difficult circumstances, with very little support. They are in the impossible position of not knowing the outcomes of different actions, but having to act anyway.
\end{quote}

Eddy, thus, argues that, that due to the nature of the complexities of assessing individual patients' conditions under the constraints in place, care targets and practice recommendations alone will not achieve better health outcome.  Instead, working under extreme uncertainty is a necessity and should be embraced with the acknolwedgement of the effects of various decision-making constraints and biases that are known to exist.

\subsection{Clinical Decision-Making} 

% TODO TODO 
Clinical decision-making biases have long been studied in the medical community.  
Modern texts for nursing and clinical evaluation have formalised the diagnostic process of determining a patient's disease or condition based on available evidence, including presenting symptoms as a technique known as \emph{differential diagnosis}~\cite{thompson2002clinical}.  This is usually described as some variation of the following procedure: First, the physician gathers all information available about the patient, creating a list of the patient's symptoms.  Then, she or he lists all possible candidate conditions for the symptoms, which is then prioritised with most the urgently dangerous possible causes first.  Finally, possible causes are ruled out or treated systematically.  

\subsection{Cognitive Dispositions to Respond}

Recent research has revealed that clinical decision-making is often strongly influenced by cognitive bias, leading to preventable adverse events, worsened patient outcomes, and higher mortality.  Croskerry et al. characterised a ~\citep{Croskerry2013}. \citet{Graber2002} states that cognitive bias is a major cause of preventable diagnostic error, but is extremely challenging to study and reduce. This complements earlier discoveries by \citet{Kahneman1982}, in which people tend to use biases when making decisions under uncertainty, occasionally leading to severe errors. Many forms of cognitive bias have been identified -- Wikipedia lists over 350\footnote{Wikipedia -- List of cognitive biases -- \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases} [Accessed 4th Sep 2014]} -- however, the consequences of biases in clinical decision making remain largely unexplored \citep{Croskerry2013}. It is thus unknown how the provision of patient data may affect bias in clinical decisions.

% research questions
By conducting a literature review of research in cognitive bias over the last 50 years, this dissertation presents a list of 11 cognitive biases which may affect clinical decisions made when patient data is used. From this, it has been identified that supplementing patient data may introduce further bias due to methods clinicians use to interpret patient data. Furthermore, it has been found that these biases usually have a more significant effect when decisions are made in acute scenarios, such as emergency rooms, where decisions must be made quickly with limited resources.

% definitions
For the purpose of this dissertation, decisions which involve patient data are called \textit{evidence-based clinical decisions}. The term \textit{patient data} refers specifically to personal information which is collected by mobile apps and consumer devices, such as the number of steps taken, video lifelogs, location history and status updates on social networks. Patient data is subsequently \textit{interpreted} by clinicians, which refers to the observation, analysis and sense-making of data.


% stuff from pete's masters thesis
Since multiple factors seemed to be potentially contributing to the slow uptake of patient-logged data in clinical practice, including temporal, situational, social, and potentially even legal constraints, we started our investigation with a broad survey of medical literature focusing on the use of data during visits with patients and hospital admissions.  

% a little bit about all the potential ways QS could help

% \cite{Swan2009} has called for use of this data as a means to supplement healthcare, which would increase ``information flow, transparency, customization, collaboration and patient choice and responsibility taking, as well as quantitative, predictive and preventive aspects.''. The use of self-tracking data in healthcare is not new. The health diary has been popular since the 1950's as a data collection method \cite{Richardson1994}.  \cite{Richardson1994} note that particular types of data that are recorded include pain, fatigue, medication use and dietary intake. This shares overlap with health and wellbeing data, suggesting there are existing use cases where health and wellbeing data could be supplemented. \cite{OLoughlin2013} has demonstrated the use of lifelogging for the purpose of increasing diet awareness. However, \cite{Swan2009} has discussed that there is currently little adoption, perhaps due to the barriers of technology in clinical environments.


\section{Pre-study: Literature Review} 

We anticipated that the slow uptake of the use of self-logged QS could potentially be attributed to a large number of factors, and thus decided it prudent to first do a survey of medical, quantified-self and HCI literature.  Our objective  was to establish a theoretical framework from which we could then identify areas that could require further investigation, as well as opportunities where research in HCI could potentially help.  

\subsection{Literature Review: Method}

We started with a set of search terms broad enough to encompass studies of clinical practice where patient-logged data (both paper-based and digital, manual and automatic) were introduced into a clinical setting.  To do this we searched PubMed, Google Scholar and the ACM DL for keywords ``patient diaries'', ``care diaries'', ``wellbeing diaries'', ``self-report diaries'', ``quantified-self'', ``smartphone apps'', and ``wearable sensors''.

Since we wanted to focus on the usage of data by medical experts, we excluded studies about use by patients themselves, such as for feedback, reflection, goal setting and self monitoring, including behaviour-change studies and studies of motivation to self-diaries, which were prevalent from the HCI community.   Focusing only on existing practice, we omitted papers describing new interfaces and systems that have not had substantial adoption.  We also excluded papers discussing the capture side of health diarising and life-logging by patients, except where aspects of capture affected its later use.  We were careful to include papers that discussed any issues relating to the use of patient data in clinical setting, including those that discussed human factors issues specifically, to more broadly  theatres and emergency rooms.

After finding a small set of results, we then broadened our search to include studies that discussed the use of patient data in medical decision-making, including both patient-supplied and clinical data held by providers themselves.  We included ``telemonitoring'', and ``electronic patient records''.  This  hoped to find a broad range of factors spanning human-factors issues to social, cultural, institutional, situational, among others.

For each paper, we identified problem(s) in the clinical use of data, which were first added to a spreadsheet and linked to their original source.  After examining each of the papers, 2 researchers organised the list into themes, attempting to merge all problems with the same underlying cause, while keeping those that did not overlap distinct.  During this process, we identified a set of themes related specifically to cognitive biases, which we analysed and report separately below.

\subsection{Literature Review: Results}

From an initial set of 2340 results, we identified 429 papers that actually contained at least one of the search terms among keywords and the abstract. From here, we identified $XX$ relevant papers according to the criteria defined above.  From this we derived the $CC$ themes visible in \ref{fig:themes}, omitting themes pertaining to cognitive dispositions to respond which we discuss next.
