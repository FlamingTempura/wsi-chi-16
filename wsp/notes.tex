% \item[Affect heuristic] %LOW - peripheral
%   Decisions are influenced by current emotions, such as happiness or sadness
% \item[Ambiguity effect] % LOW - problem: missing datasolution: data completion
%   If the probability of having a favourable outcome is only available for some options, other options tend not be considered
% \item[Anchoring and adjustment] %LOW - peripheral events
%   A greater importance is placed on the first piece of information offered when making decisions
% \item[Availability heuristic] %LOW - problem: peripheral data
%   Information which is considered more important, such as recent information, is heavy relied upon for decision making
% \item[Clustering illusion] %LOW/HIGH - interpretation, salience
%   Given a distribution, clusters of data points may be observed and, despite their statistical insignificance, be used to influence a decision
% \item[Confirmation bias] %LOW - %individual biasinterpretation
%   One's own beliefs influence judgements and decisions
% \item[Contrast effect]
%   The performance of an individual changes as they are exposed to repeated similar tasks
% \item[Curse of knowledge] %care delivery
%   People who are more informed on particular problems are unlikely to think about them from the perspective of less informed people
% \item[Extension neglect] %LOW/HIGH - interpretation
%   The size of a sample or statistical significance of an observation has little influence on its value in helping make a decision
% \item[Framing effect]
%   The way a problem is stated affects the outcomes
% \item[Functional fixedness]
%   People are limited to using an object only in the way it was intended.
% \item[Illusory correlation] % interpretation
%   Perceived relationship between variables that doesn't exist (for example Sterotyping)
% \item[Observer-expectancy effect] %HIGH - peripheralsalience
%   Observations made may be biased based on the observer's expected outcomes of a study
% \item[Priming]
%   Exposure to one stimulus influences the response to another stimulus (needs rephrase)
% \item[Probability neglect]
%   Disregard of probability when making a decision under uncertainty
% \item[Representativeness heuristic] %LOW - problem: peripheral data
%   Decisions are made based on information about a prototype of an object or an event
