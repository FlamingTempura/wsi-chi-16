  abstract = {Cognitive errors underlie most diagnostic errors that are made in the course of clinical decision-making in the emergency department. These errors are universal and are prevalent in the special milieu of the ED. Their properties appear to be distinct from those associated with the performance of procedures. They are often costly, but, importantly for both the patient and the physician, they are also highly preventable. Recent developments in education theory provide a means for minimizing and avoiding diagnostic error. Through the process of metacognition, clinicians can develop cognitive forcing strategies to abort such latent errors. Three levels of cognitive forcing strategies are described: universal, generic, and specific. Specific cognitive forcing strategies provide a formal cognitive debiasing approach to deal with what have previously been described as pitfalls in clinical reasoning. This metacognitive approach can be taught to practicing clinicians and to those in training to inoculate them against making diagnostic errors. The adoption of this method provides a systematic approach to cognitive root-cause analysis in the avoidance of adverse outcomes associated with delayed or missed diagnoses and with the clinical management of specific cases.},

Yet, most people cannot wade through all of this data to answer basic questions about their long-term wellbeing: Do I gain weight when I have busy days? Do I walk more when I work in the city? Do I sleep better on nights after I work out? We built the Health Mashups system to identify connections that are significant over time between weight, sleep, step count, calendar data, location, weather, pain, food intake, and mood. These significant observations are displayed in a mobile application using natural language, for example, ``You are happier on days when you sleep more.'' We performed a pilot study, made improvements to the system, and then conducted a 90-day trial with 60 diverse participants, learning that interactions between wellbeing and context are highly individual and that our system supported an increased self-understanding that lead to focused behavior changes.},

Predictably Irrational is an intriguing, witty and utterly original look at why we all make illogical decisions. Why can a 50p aspirin do what a 5p aspirin can't? If an item is "free" it must be a bargain, right? Why is everything relative, even when it shouldn't be? How do our expectations influence our actual opinions and decisions? In this astounding book, behavioural economist Dan Ariely cuts to the heart of our strange behaviour, demonstrating how irrationality often supplants rational thought and that the reason for this is embedded in the very structure of our minds. Predicatably Irrational brilliantly blends everyday experiences with a series of illuminating and often surprising experiments, that will change your understanding of human behaviour. And, by recognising these patterns, Ariely shows that we can make better decisions in business, in matters of collective welfare, and in our everyday lives from drinking coffee to losing weight, buying a car to choosing a romantic partner.},

These differences in the magnitude of the anchoring effect appear to be mediated by differences in the perceived plausibility of the anchors.

@article{Crosby2007,
  abstract = {Purpose To provide a narrative review of the physician experience of medical malpractice litigation applied to an anesthesiology case with particular emphasis on the role played by medical expert witnesses. Sources Literature searches were conducted of English-language medical publications published between 1996 {\textendash} 2006 using both Medline and Pubmed databases. Key words included: ``medical malpractice''; ``medical malpractice litigation''; ``medical expert witness''; ``expert witness liability'', ``expert witness bias''; ``hindsight bias''; and ``outcome bias''. Principal findings Patient injury resulting from medical care is common but most injured patients do not sue. Implicit review of medical files is biased to an important degree by the occurrence of severe injury; care is more often deemed substandard when the resulting injury is severe. Expert analysis of medical mal-occurrences is influenced by both hindsight and outcome bias. Compensation for those who do sue is influenced by the severity of injury and the degree of disability. The activity of experts is not commonly subject to review by peers, professional groups or licensing authorities. Conclusions The legal process for resolving patient claims against physicians is well delineated and transparent; its operational features are complex and prejudiced by severe outcomes. Bias is pervasive in the analysis of medical occurrences and may result in findings against caregivers which are unfair.},

@article{Jalal2014,
  abstract = {Cognitive models of social anxiety posit that recurrent interpretation of ambiguous information as threatening is involved in maintaining symptoms of social anxiety. Researchers have used several methodologies to assess interpretation bias in social anxiety, including homographs (i.e., words with two meanings, e.g., chicken-poultry and chicken-scared). In the current study, we examined the effects of priming in 21 individuals with social anxiety disorder and 21 non-anxious control participants. All participants completed a homograph priming paradigm. In this task, participants see a fixation cross followed by a homograph prime. This homograph is then followed by related or unrelated neutral, physical, or social threat target words examining the priming effect of the homograph on the target. As hypothesized, for non-threat targets, we obtained the typical priming effect in all participants. Moreover, we found that individuals with social anxiety disorder were slower to respond to related social threat targets compared to unrelated social threat targets when these targets were preceded by socially relevant homographs. These data suggest that individuals with social anxiety disorder inhibit social threat meaning of ambiguous primes perhaps due to a vigilance-avoidance pattern of threat relevant information.},

@article{Koehler1996,
  abstract = {We have been oversold on the base rate fallacy in probabilistic judgment from an empirical, normative, and methodological standpoint. At the empirical level, a thorough examination of the base rate literature (including the famous lawyer{\textendash}engineer problem) does not support the conventional wisdom that people routinely ignore base rates. Quite the contrary, the literature shows that base rates are almost always used and that their degree of use depends on task structure and representation. Specifically, base rates play a relatively larger role in tasks where base rates are implicitly learned or can be represented in frequentist terms. Base rates are also used more when they are reliable and relatively more diagnostic than available individuating information. At the normative level, the base rate fallacy should be rejected because few tasks map unambiguously into the narrow framework that is held up as the standard of good decision making. Mechanical applications of Bayes's theorem to identify performance errors are inappropriate when (1) key assumptions of the model are either unchecked or grossly violated, and (2) no attempt is made to identify the decision maker's goals, values, and task assumptions. Methodologically, the current approach is criticized for its failure to consider how the ambiguous, unreliable, and unstable base rates of the real world are and should be used. Where decision makers' assumptions and goals vary, and where performance criteria are complex, the traditional Bayesian standard is insufficient. Even where predictive accuracy is the goal in commonly defined problems, there may be situations (e.g., informationally redundant environments) in which base rates can be ignored with impunity. A more ecologically valid research program is called for. This program should emphasize the development of prescriptive theory in rich, realistic decision environments.},

Althoughmany scholars have presumed that these so-called response effects are likely to be morepronounced when the attitudes being measured are weak, a number of studies have disconfirmedthis notion. This paper presents several new tests of this hypothesis using a variety of measuresand analytic techniques. The findings largely replicated previously documented effects andnon-effects but also uncovered new effects not previously tested. No single strength-relatedattitude attribute emerged as a consistent moderator of all response effects. Rather, differentindividual attributes moderated different effects, and a conglomeration of strength-relateddimensions did not emerge as a reliable moderator. Taken together, these results support theconclusions that different response effects occur as the result of different cognitive processes,and that various strength-related attitude attributes reflect distinct latent constructs rather than asingle one.},

  abstract = {Background: The likelihood judgments that people make about their risks for cancer have important implications. At the individual level, risk estimates guide protective actions, such as cancer screening. However, at the extremes, exaggerated risk judgments can also lead to anxiety that degrades quality of life or to aggressive self-protective actions that are unwarranted given the objective risks. At the policy level, risk judgments may serve as an indicator of societal perceptions of the ``war'' against cancer. Using risk judgments, the public expresses its belief about whether we are winning.Purpose: We present theoretical perspectives from judgment and decision making, illustrate how they can explain some of the existing empirical findings in the cancer risk literature, and describe additional predictions that have not yet been tested.Conclusions: Overall, we suggest that theories from the judgment and decision-making perspective offer a potentially powerful view for understanding and improving risk judgments for cancer and other diseases.},

  abstract = {Theory in nursing is frequently thought of as being a mainly academic exercise with little relevance to the everyday practice of nursing. In nursing there is disagreement about what theory is and what it is not. Scientific theory is an abstract systematic explanation of how concepts are related to each other. Many nursing theories do not fit this description and should therefore, in the opinion of the authors, be thought of as models. Nursing knowledge has been described as the knowledge that is useful to nurses, whether it is derived from the discipline of nursing or other disciplines.

Decision-making (DM) and triage nursing have been investigated by several nurse researchers, however, most have not clearly articulated a theoretical or conceptual framework. The recognition primed decision (RPD) model is based on research about DM under uncertain conditions such as time pressure, limited time available, high stakes, and changing cues. The context of emergency triage nursing DM is congruent with the RPD model. The authors propose that the RPD model can serve as a foundation for research that seeks to understand DM by triage nurses with the aim of yielding new knowledge that is useful for their practice.},

It is noted that there is a paucity of evidence in this field, particularly when examining specific manipulations. Only 3 categories of manipulation had 3 or more studies. The available evidence shows that the way information is presented can have significant effects on decisions made. The largest effects were evident when relative risk information was presented, as compared with absolute risk data. In addition, "loss framing" was more effective in influencing screening uptake behaviors than "gain". There was also a pattern of evidence from studies comparing simpler with more complex information, more data with less, and those comparing numerical with verbal descriptions of risks. These studies suggest that providing more information, and which is more understandable to the patient, is associated with improved patient knowledge and a greater wariness to take treatments or participate in trials. These findings can contribute to efforts to improve communications between professionals and patients.},

Two experiments with college students support the hypothesis that base-rate neglect may be minimized by providing base-rate training in the absence of case, or witness, cues, prior to introducing (or reintroducing) these cues. In Experiment 1, the hypothesis was supported by both within-subjects and between-groups assessments; in Experiment 2, the hypothesis was supported while the effects of instructions and a correction procedure were found to be minimal. In Experiment 1, but not in Experiment 2, training with case cues present also reduced base-rate neglect, but this effect was not sufficient to account for the effect of cue-absent base-rate training. Correction trials led some subjects to detect that the task contingencies were random; however, neither this nor actually telling subjects after the experiment that the task was indeed random led invariably to subjects' describing the optimal strategy (which was to choose the richer alternative exclusively).},

@inproceedings{Halford2010,
  abstract = {A clarion call for a new research agenda has been sounded, notably by Berners-Lee et al (2006a 2006b) and Hendler et al (2008) for a `science of decentralised information systems' to `discover' generative mechanisms, and synthesise knowledge and technology to push both forwards. Computer Science alone - focussing as it does on the engineering/technology of the web - could not deliver the ambitions of this new agenda. Equally, other disciplines implicated in Web Science might use the web to support their research, or be interested in virtual life, but they lacked a coherent or unifying mandate for engaging with the web. By calling for Web Science these pioneers opened up a new space. But this is uncharted terrain. As a technology the web is still new. While it has grown rapidly and unexpectedly we are only just beginning to think about the web as a phenomena to be studied. The proponents of Web Science had the vision to see that this new approach had to include disciplines beyond their own; it had to be greater than the sum of the parts of individual disciplines. This is a radical call to leave disciplinary silos and work collaboratively to produce something bigger and better. Moreover, it takes in the founding principles of the web and a desire for a web that is pro-human: this is a call for a science that is capable of insight and intervention to create a better world. Our paper aims to take up this challenge and suggests how we might map the Web Science terrain. We come at this from a slightly different direction to the web science pioneers and want to demonstrate how social science can, and indeed must, contribute to developing Web Science. This paper will explore the contribution of social theory and sociological concepts that shape how we engage with the web. We focus on four key aspects which seem to be central to this understanding. Firstly co-constitution, the fact that the web both shapes and is shaped by humans/society. Secondly the importance of heterogeneous networks of multiple and diverse actors (including technologies themselves) that make the web as we know it. Thirdly the significance of performativity, that the web is an unfolding, enacted practice, as people interact with http to build `the web' moment by moment. Finally, drawing these ideas together we see the web we have now as an immutable mobile or temporarily stabilised network. We use these ideas to map what web science could be and to suggest how we might use sociology to understand the web. Our aim is to provoke and stimulate debate and to move beyond superficial popular psychology and sociology (which envisages engineering human behaviour) and to challenge some of the ways in which social science has engaged with technology and technical actors. To facilitate this, and taking our lead from Donna Harroway, the paper sets out a radical manifesto for web science.},

  abstract = {Assessing what other people know and believe is critical for accurately understanding human action. Young children find it difficult to reason about false beliefs (i.e., beliefs that conflict with reality). The source of this difficulty is a matter of considerable debate. Here we show that if sensitive-enough measures are used, adults show deficits in a false-belief task similar to one used with young children. In particular, we show a curse-of-knowledge bias in false-belief reasoning. That is, adults' own knowledge of an event's outcome can compromise their ability to reason about another person's beliefs about that event. We also found that adults'perception of the plausibility of an event mediates the extent of this bias. These findings shed light on the factors involved in false-belief reasoning and are discussed in light of their implications for both adults' and children's social cognition.},

However, current tools do not have sufficient understanding of users' self-reflection needs to appropriately leverage Ubicomp technologies. To design tools that effectively assist self-reflection, we need to comprehensively understand what kinds of questions people have about their data, why they ask these questions, how they answer them with current tools, and what kinds of problems they encounter. To explore this, we conducted interviews with people who use various kinds of tools for personal informatics. We found six kinds of questions that people asked about their data. We also found that certain kinds of questions are more important at certain times, which we call phases. We identified two phases of reflection: Discovery and Maintenance. We discuss the kinds of questions and the phases in detail and identify features that should be supported in personal informatics tools for which Ubicomp technologies can play an important role.},

It is vulnerable to a variety of failings, the most prevalent arising through cognitive and affective influences. The impact of diagnostic failure on patient safety does not appear to have been fully recognized. Ideally, all information used in diagnostic reasoning is objective and all thinking is logical and valid, but these conditions are not always met. Two major phenomena that may undermine objectivity and rational thinking are cognitive dispositions to respond (CDRs) and affective dispositions to respond (ADRs) toward the patient. In this report, the determinants and characteristics of the major CDRs and ADRs are reviewed, as are a variety of de-biasing strategies that may mitigate their influence. A retrospective analytical process, the cognitive and affective autopsy, is also described. The purpose of this report is to provide insight into cognitive and affective influences that have resulted in delayed or missed diagnoses.},

  abstract = {Lifelogging is the process of automatically recording aspects of one's life in digital form. This includes visual lifelogging using wearable cameras such as the SenseCam and in recent years many interesting applications for this have emerged and are being actively researched. One of the most interesting of these, and possibly the most far-reaching, is using visual lifelogs as a memory prosthesis but there are also applications in job-specific activity recording, general lifestyle analysis and market analysis.

In this work we describe a technique which allowed us to develop automatic classifiers for visual lifelogs to infer different lifestyle traits or characteristics. Their accuracy was validated on a set of 95 k manually annotated images and through one-on-one interviews with those who gathered the images. These automatic classifiers were then applied to a collection of over 3 million lifelog images collected by 33 individuals sporadically over a period of 3.5 years. From this collection we present a number of anecdotal observations to demonstrate the future potential of lifelogging to capture human behaviour. These anecdotes include: the eating habits of office workers; to the amount of time researchers spend outdoors through the year; to the observation that retired people in our study appear to spend quite a bit of time indoors eating with friends. We believe this work demonstrates the potential of lifelogging techniques to assist behavioural scientists in future.},

@article{Thomas2000,
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ongoing debate on the incidence and types of iatrogenic injuries in American hospitals has been informed primarily by the Harvard Medical Practice Study, which analyzed hospitalizations in New York in 1984. The generalizability of these findings is unknown and has been questioned by other studies.
OBJECTIVE: We used methods similar to the Harvard Medical Practice Study to estimate the incidence and types of adverse events and negligent adverse events in Utah and Colorado in 1992.
DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: We selected a representative sample of hospitals from Utah and Colorado and then randomly sampled 15,000 nonpsychiatric 1992 discharges. Each record was screened by a trained nurse-reviewer for 1 of 18 criteria associated with adverse events. If \ensuremath{>} or =1 criteria were present, the record was reviewed by a trained physician to determine whether an adverse event or negligent adverse event occurred and to classify the type of adverse event.
MEASURES: The measures were adverse events and negligent adverse events.
RESULTS: Adverse events occurred in 2.9+/-0.2\% (mean+/-SD) of hospitalizations in each state. In Utah, 32.6+/-4\% of adverse events were due to negligence; in Colorado, 27.4+/-2.4\%. Death occurred in 6.6+/-1.2\% of adverse events and 8.8+/-2.5\% of negligent adverse events. Operative adverse events comprised 44.9\% of all adverse events; 16.9\% were negligent, and 16.6\% resulted in permanent disability. Adverse drug events were the leading cause of nonoperative adverse events (19.3\% of all adverse events; 35.1\% were negligent, and 9.7\% caused permanent disability). Most adverse events were attributed to surgeons (46.1\%, 22.3\% negligent) and internists (23.2\%, 44.9\% negligent).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence and types of adverse events in Utah and Colorado in 1992 were similar to those in New York State in 1984. Iatrogenic injury continues to be a significant public health problem. Improving systems of surgical care and drug delivery could substantially reduce the burden of iatrogenic injury.},

Through the use of checklists, case examples, and exercises, author Arlene Fink unravels the intricacies of* Selecting questions to maximize the efficiency of the review* Identifying subject headings and key words for electronic searches* Identifying the most appropriate databases, including supplementing computer and Web-based searches* Dealing with unpublished studies* Setting inclusion and exclusion criteria* Justifying methods for reviewing only the 'highest quality' literature* Preparing a structured literature abstraction form* Ensuring the reliability and validity of the review* Synthesizing and reporting results* Conducting and evaluating descriptive literature reviews* How to understand and evaluate the principles of meta-analysisNew to the Second Edition: * Flow diagrams to assist the reader in linking each step of the review to the contents of each chapter * New references and other online resources, including links to online literature reviews and meta-analyses * Guidance in choosing online public and private bibliographic databases for literature reviews * Tips for searching the web for research informationThe text also discusses the use of Boolean operators for simple and advanced searches and shows readers how to use bibliographic software to organize literature reviews and search 'The Virtual File Cabinet.' It also describes how to synthesize the literature as a stand-alone report or as a component of a paper or proposal.This book is intended for anyone wants to research social, health, educational, and business issues. It is ideal for students, researchers, marketers, planners, and policymakers who design and manage public and private agencies, conduct research studies, and prepare strategic plans and grant proposals.Praise for the First Edition'There is finally a book available that removes the mystery and guesswork from doing literature reviews. This is especially important for both graduate and undergraduate levels if you are asking the students to make judgments about the quality and applicability of articles they may read. This book is not only timely but also a valuable way to help students evaluate articles they find on the Internet.' --Anita VanBrackle, Kennesaw State University},

  abstract = {In 5 studies, undergraduate subjects were given descriptions and outcomes of decisions made by others under conditions of uncertainty. Decisions concerned either medical matters or monetary gambles. Subjects rated the quality of thinking of the decisions, the competence of the decision maker, or their willingness to let the decision maker decide on their behalf. Subjects understood that they had all relevant information available to the decision maker. Subjects rated the thinking as better, rated the decision maker as more competent, or indicated greater willingness to yield the decision when the outcome was favorable than when it was unfavorable. In monetary gambles, subjects rated the thinking as better when the outcome of the option not chosen turned out poorly than when it turned out well. Although subjects who were asked felt that they should not consider outcomes in making these evaluations, they did so. This effect of outcome knowledge on evaluation may be explained partly in terms of its effect on the salience of arguments for each side of the choice. Implications for the theory of rationality and for practical situations are discussed.},

  abstract = {People strive to obtain self-knowledge. A class of systems called personal informatics is appearing that help people collect and reflect on personal information. However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people's lives to enrich the value of systems.},

  abstract = {Affect is considered by most contemporary theories to be postcognitive, that is, to occur only after considerable cognitive operations have been accomplished. Yet a number of experimental results on preferences, attitudes, impression formation, and decision making, as well as some clinical phenomena, suggest that affective judgments may be fairly independent of, and precede in time, the sorts of perceptual and cognitive operations commonly assumed to be the basis of these affective judgments. Affective reactions to stimuli are often the very first reactions of the organism, and for lower organisms they are the dominant reactions. Affective reactions can occur without extensive perceptual and cognitive encoding, are made with greater confidence than cognitive judgments, and can be made sooner. Experimental evidence is presented demonstrating that reliable affective discriminations (like{\textendash}dislike ratings) can be made in the total absence of recognition memory (old{\textendash}new judgments). Various differences between judgments based on affect and those based on perceptual and cognitive processes are examined. It is concluded that affect and cognition are under the control of separate and partially independent systems that can influence each other in a variety of ways, and that both constitute independent sources of effects in information processing.

@article{Chau2002,
  abstract = {The proliferation of information technology (IT) in supporting highly specialized tasks and services has made it increasingly important to understand the factors essential to technology acceptance by individuals. In a typical professional setting, the essential characteristics of user, technology, and context may differ considerably from those in ordinary business settings. This study examined physicians' acceptance of telemedicine technology. Following a theory comparison approach, it evaluated the extent to which prevailing intention-based models, including the technology acceptance model (TAM), the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and an integrated model, could explain individual physicians' technology acceptance decisions. Based on responses from more than 400 physicians, both models were evaluated in terms of overall fit, explanatory power, and their causal links. Overall, findings suggest that TAM may be more appropriate than TPB for examining technology acceptance by individual professionals and that the integrated model, although more fully depicting physicians' technology acceptance, may not provide significant additional explanatory power. Also, instruments developed and repeatedly tested in prior studies involving conventional end-users and business managers may not be valid in professional settings. Several interesting implications are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Objectives To describe an implementation of one information technology system (electronic medical record, EMR) in one hospital, the perceived impact, the factors thought to help and hinder implementation and the success of the system and compare this with theories of effective IT implementation. To draw on previous research, empirical data from this study is used to develop IT implementation theory.
Design Qualitative case study, replicating the methods and questions of a previously published USA EMR implementation study using semi-structured interviews and documentation.
Setting Large Swedish teaching hospital shortly after a merger of two hospital sites.
Participants Thirty senior clinicians, managers, project team members, doctors and nurses.
Results The Swedish implementation was achieved within a year and for under half the budget, with a generally popular EMR which was thought to save time and improve the quality of patient care. Evidence from this study and findings from the more problematic USA implementation case suggests that key factors for cost effective implementation and operation were features of the system itself, the implementation process and the conditions under which the implementation was carried out.
Conclusion There is empirical support for the IT implementation theory developed in this study, which provides a sound basis for future research and successful implementation. Successful implementation of an EMR is likely with an intuitive system, requiring little training, already well developed for clinical work but allowing flexibility for development, where clinicians are involved in selection and in modification for their department needs and where a realistic timetable is made using an assessment of the change-capability of the organization. Once a system decision is made, the implementation should be driven by top and departmental leaders assisted by competent project teams involving information technology specialists and users. Corrections for unforeseen eventualities will be needed, especially with less developed systems, requiring regular reviews of progress and modifications to systems and timetables to respond to user needs.},

@article{Gurrin2013,
  abstract = {Background
The Microsoft SenseCam, a small camera that is worn on the chest via a lanyard, increasingly is being deployed in health research. However, the SenseCam and other wearable cameras are not yet in widespread use because of a variety of factors. It is proposed that the ubiquitous smartphones can provide a more accessible alternative to SenseCam and similar devices.
Purpose
To perform an initial evaluation of the potential of smartphones to become an alternative to a wearable camera such as the SenseCam.
Methods
In 2012, adults were supplied with a smartphone, which they wore on a lanyard, that ran life-logging software. Participants wore the smartphone for up to 1 day and the resulting life-log data were both manually annotated and automatically analyzed for the presence of visual concepts. The results were compared to prior work using the SenseCam.
Results
In total, 166,000 smartphone photos were gathered from 47 individuals, along with associated sensor readings. The average time spent wearing the device across all users was 5 hours 39 minutes (SD=4 hours 11 minutes). A subset of 36,698 photos was selected for manual annotation by five researchers. Software analysis of these photos supports the automatic identification of activities to a similar level of accuracy as for SenseCam images in a previous study.
Conclusions
Many aspects of the functionality of a SenseCam largely can be replicated, and in some cases enhanced, by the ubiquitous smartphone platform. This makes smartphones good candidates for a new generation of wearable sensing devices in health research, because of their widespread use across many populations. It is envisioned that smartphones will provide a compelling alternative to the dedicated SenseCam hardware for a number of users and application areas. This will be achieved by integrating new types of sensor data, leveraging the smartphone's real-time connectivity and rich user interface, and providing support for a range of relatively sophisticated applications.},

  abstract = {Medication taking is a self-regulatory process that requires individuals to self-monitor their medication taking behaviors, but this can be difficult because medication taking is such a mundane, unremarkable behavior. Ubiquitous sensing systems have the potential to sense everyday behaviors and provide the objective feedback necessary for self-regulation of medication taking. We describe an unobtrusive sensing system consisting of a sensor-augmented pillbox and an ambient display that provides near real-time visual feedback about how well medications are being taken. In contrast to other systems that focus on reminding before medication taking, our approach uses feedback after medication taking to allow the individual to develop their own routines through self-regulation. We evaluated this system in the homes of older adults in a 10-month deployment. Feedback helped improve the consistency of medication-taking behaviors as well as increased ratings of self-efficacy. However, the improved performance did not persist after the feedback display was removed, because individuals had integrated the feedback display into their routines to support their self-awareness, identify mistakes, guide the timing of medication taking, and provide a sense of security that they are taking their medications well. Finally, we reflect on design considerations for feedback systems to support the process of self-regulation of everyday behaviors.},

Participants who lacked control were more likely to perceive a variety of illusory patterns, including seeing images in noise, forming illusory correlations in stock market information, perceiving conspiracies, and developing superstitions. Additionally, we demonstrated that increased pattern perception has a motivational basis by measuring the need for structure directly and showing that the causal link between lack of control and illusory pattern perception is reduced by affirming the self. Although these many disparate forms of pattern perception are typically discussed as separate phenomena, the current results suggest that there is a common motive underlying them.},

@article{Graber2002,
  abstract = {This review considers the feasibility of reducing or eliminating the three major categories of diagnostic errors in medicine: "No-fault errors" occur when the disease is silent, presents atypically, or mimics something more common. These errors will inevitably decline as medical science advances, new syndromes are identified, and diseases can be detected more accurately or at earlier stages. These errors can never be eradicated, unfortunately, because new diseases emerge, tests are never perfect, patients are sometimes noncompliant, and physicians will inevitably, at times, choose the most likely diagnosis over the correct one, illustrating the concept of necessary fallibility and the probabilistic nature of choosing a diagnosis. "System errors" play a role when diagnosis is delayed or missed because of latent imperfections in the health care system. These errors can be reduced by system improvements, but can never be eliminated because these improvements lag behind and degrade over time, and each new fix creates the opportunity for novel errors. Tradeoffs also guarantee system errors will persist, when resources are just shifted. "Cognitive errors" reflect misdiagnosis from faulty data collection or interpretation, flawed reasoning, or incomplete knowledge. The limitations of human processing and the inherent biases in using heuristics guarantee that these errors will persist. Opportunities exist, however, for improving the cognitive aspect of diagnosis by adopting system-level changes (e.g., second opinions, decision-support systems, enhanced access to specialists) and by training designed to improve cognition or cognitive awareness. Diagnostic error can be substantially reduced, but never eradicated.},

We report the findings of a functionality review of 229 medication reminder apps and a thematic analysis of their 1,012 user reviews. Our research highlights the gap between the theory and practice: while the literature shows that many medication regimens are habitual in nature and the presence of daily routines supports remembering, existing apps rely on timer-based reminders. To address this disparity, we present design requirements for building medication reminders that support the routine aspect of medication-taking and its individual nature, and demonstrate how they could be implemented to move from passive alerts to a smarter memory and routine assistant.},

@article{OLoughlin2013,
  abstract = {Background
Food diaries are commonly used to assess individual dietary intake in both the general and sporting populations. Despite the widespread use of such diaries, evidence suggests that individuals' self-reported energy intake frequently and substantially underestimate true energy intake.
Purpose
To examine the use of the Microsoft SenseCam wearable camera to help more accurately report dietary intake within various sporting populations.
Methods
In 2011, a total of 47 participants were recruited to take part in this study (17 trainee jockeys, 15 elite Gaelic footballers, and 15 healthy physically active university students). Participants wore a SenseCam for 1 day (from morning until night) while simultaneously keeping a 1-day food diary. Comparisons were made between the energy intake reported in the food diary alone and the food diary in conjunction with information gathered from the SenseCam. Data analysis was conducted in 2012.
Results
Mean total calorie intake using diary alone and diary and SenseCam were 2349\ensuremath{{\pm}}827.9 kcals vs 2631\ensuremath{{\pm}}893.4 kcal for the trainee jockeys; 2600\ensuremath{{\pm}}521.9 kcal vs 3191\ensuremath{{\pm}}770.2 kcal for the Gaelic footballers, and 2237\ensuremath{{\pm}}318.5 kcal vs 2487\ensuremath{{\pm}}404.6 kcal for the university students. This represented a difference of 10.7\% (p\ensuremath{{\leq}}0.001); 17.7\% (p\ensuremath{{\leq}}0.001); and 10.1\% (p\ensuremath{{\leq}}0.01) among measurement methods for trainee jockeys, Gaelic footballers, and university students, respectively.
Conclusions
Results from this first-generation study suggest that a more accurate estimate of total energy intake is provided when combining the use of a conventional food diary and a SenseCam. Additional information on portion size, forgotten foods, leftovers, and brand names can be obtained by using this novel sensing technology in conjunction with the diary, with improved dietary assessment a potential outcome.},

The effects of this tendency have been repeatedly documented in clinical research. However, its ramifications for the behavior of scientists have yet to be adequately explored. For example, although publication is a critical element in determining the contribution and impact of scientific findings, little research attention has been devoted to the variables operative in journal review policies. In the present study, 75 journal reviewers were asked to referee manuscripts which described identical experimental procedures but which reported positive, negative, mixed, or no results. In addition to showing poor interrater agreement, reviewers were strongly biased against manuscripts which reported results contrary to their theoretical perspective. The implications of these findings for epistemology and the peer review system are briefly addressed.},

In this work, we aim to gain insights from these "extreme users," who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor. We identify future research efforts that could help make progress toward addressing these pitfalls. We also discuss how our findings can have broad implications in designing and developing self-tracking technologies.},

This heuristic is explicated in a series of empirical examples demonstrating predictable and systematic errors in the evaluation of uncertain events. In particular, since sample size does not represent any property of the population, it is expected to have little or no effect on judgment of likelihood. This prediction is confirmed in studies showing that subjective sampling distributions and posterior probability judgments are determined by the most salient characteristic of the sample (e.g., proportion, mean) without regard to the size of the sample. The present heuristic approach is contrasted with the normative (Bayesian) approach to the analysis of the judgment of uncertainty.},

@article{OHara2008,
  abstract = {The growth of information acquisition, storage and retrieval capacity has led to the development of the practice of lifelogging, the undiscriminating collection of information concerning one's life and behaviour. There are potential problems in this practice, but equally it could be empowering for the individual, and provide a new locus for the construction of an online identity. In this paper we look at the technological possibilities and constraints for lifelogging tools, and set out some of the most important privacy, identity and empowerment-related issues. We argue that some of the privacy concerns are overblown, and that much research and commentary on lifelogging has made the unrealistic assumption that the information gathered is for private use, whereas, in a more socially-networked online world, much of it will have public functions and will be voluntarily released into the public domain.},

Four heuristics for the design and evaluation of such systems have been identified through analysis of self-tracking devices and apps. Dashboard interface paradigms in specific self-tracking devices (Fitbit and Basis) are discussed as representative examples of state of the art in feedback and reflection support. By relating to existing work in other domains, such as event related representation of time series multivariate data in financial analytics, it is discussed how the heuristics could guide designs that would further facilitate reflection in self-tracking personal informatics systems.},

@article{Norman2010,
  abstract = {CONTEXT: There is a growing literature on diagnostic errors. The consensus of this literature is that most errors are cognitive and result from the application of one or more cognitive biases. Such biased reasoning is usually associated with 'System 1' (non-analytic, pattern recognition) thinking.
METHODS: We review this literature and bring in evidence from two other fields: research on clinical reasoning, and research in psychology on 'dual-process' models of thinking. We then synthesise the evidence from these fields exploring possible causes of error and potential solutions.
RESULTS: We identify that, in fact, there is very little evidence to associate diagnostic errors with System 1 (non-analytical) reasoning. By contrast, studies of dual processing show that experts are as likely to commit errors when they are attempting to be systematic and analytical. We then examine the effectiveness of various approaches to reducing errors. We point out that educational strategies aimed at explaining cognitive biases are unlikely to succeed because of limited transfer. Conversely, there is an accumulation of evidence that interventions directed at specifically encouraging both analytical and non-analytical reasoning have been shown to result in small, but consistent, improvements in accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic errors are not simply a consequence of cognitive biases or over-reliance on one kind of thinking. They result from multiple causes and are associated with both analytical and non-analytical reasoning. Limited evidence suggests that strategies directed at encouraging both kinds of reasoning will lead to limited gains in accuracy.},

Subjects become ``fixed'' on the design function of the object, and problem solving suffers relative to control conditions in which the object's function is not demonstrated. In the current study, such functional fixedness was demonstrated in a sample of adolescents (mean age of 16 years) among the Shuar of Ecuadorian Amazonia, whose technologically sparse culture provides limited access to large numbers of artifacts with highly specialized functions. This result suggests that design function may universally be the core property of artifact concepts in human semantic memory.},

Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

More specifically, we assert that an answer to an attitude question is the product of a four-stage process. Respondents first interpret the attitude question, determining what attitude the question is about. They then retrieve relevant beliefs and feelings. Next, they apply these beliefs and feelings in rendering the appropriate judgment. Finally, they use this judgment to select a response. All four of the component processes can be affected by prior items. The prior items can provide a framework for interpreting later questions and can also make some responses appear to be redundant with earlier answers. The prior items can prime some beliefs, making them more accessible to the retrieval process. The prior items can suggest a norm or standard of comparison for making the judgment. Finally, the prior items can create consistency pressures or pressures to appear moderate.},

  abstract = {Clinical decision making is a cornerstone of high-quality care in emergency medicine. The density of decision making is unusually high in this unique milieu, and a combination of strategies has necessarily evolved to manage the load. In addition to the traditional hypothetico-deductive method, emergency physicians use several other approaches, principal among which are heuristics. These cognitive short-cutting strategies are especially adaptive under the time and resource limitations that prevail in many emergency departments (EDs), but occasionally they fail. When they do, we refer to them as cognitive errors. They are costly but highly preventable. It is important that emergency physicians be aware of the nature and extent of these heuristics and biases, or cognitive dispositions to respond (CDRs). Thirty are catalogued in this article, together with descriptions of their properties as well as the impact they have on clinical decision making in the ED. Strategies are delineated in each case, to minimize their occurrence. Detection and recognition of these cognitive phenomena are a first step in achieving cognitive de-biasing to improve clinical decision making in the ED.},

  abstract = {As the adoption of information technology has increased, so too has the demands that these systems become more adapted to the physicians and nurses environments, to make access and management of information easier. The developers of information systems in Healthcare must use quality management techniques to ensure that their product will satisfy given requirements. This underlines the importance of the preliminary phase where Users Requirements are elicited. Some methodologies, such as KAVAS (E.M.S. Van Gennip, F. Gr\'{e}my, Med. Inform. 18, 1993, 179) chose to use a continuous assessment protocol as a key strategy for quality management. At each stage of the conception and development of a prototype, the assessment checks that it conforms to the expectation of the users' requirements. The methodology of evaluation is then seen as a dynamic process which is able to improve the design and development of a dedicated system. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the necessity to include a cognitive evaluation phase in the process of evaluation by: (1) evaluating the integration (usability) of the I.T. in the activity of the users; and (2) understanding the motives underlying their management of information. This will help the necessary integration of information management in the workload of the healthcare professionals and the compatibility of the prototypes with the daily activity of the users.},

  abstract = {In the area of patient safety, recent attention has focused on diagnostic error. A critical subset of diagnostic errors arises through cognitive errors, especially those associated with failures in perception, failed heuristics, and biases; collectively, these have been referred to as cognitive dispositions to respond (CDRs). Historically, models of decision-making have given insufficient attention to the contribution of such biases, and there has been a prevailing pessimism against improving cognitive performance through debiasing techniques. Recent work has catalogued the major cognitive biases in medicine; the author lists these and describes a number of strategies for reducing them. Principle among them is metacognition, a reflective approach to problem solving that involves stepping back from the immediate problem to examine and reflect on the thinking process. Further research effort should be directed at a full and complete description and analysis of CDRs in the context of medicine and the development of techniques for avoiding their associated adverse outcomes. Considerable potential exists for reducing cognitive diagnostic errors with this approach. The author provides an extensive list of CDRs and a list of strategies to reduce diagnostic errors.},

@article{Bar-Hillel1980,
  abstract = {The base-rate fallacy is people's tendency to ignore base rates in favor of, e.g., individuating information (when such is available), rather than integrate the two. This tendency has important implications for understanding judgment phenomena in many clinical, legal, and social-psychological settings. An explanation of this phenomenon is offered, according to which people order information by its perceived degree of relevance, and let high-relevance information dominate low-relevance information. Information is deemed more relevant when it relates more specifically to a judged target case. Specificity is achieved either by providing information on a smaller set than the overall population, of which the target case is a member, or when information can be coded, via causality, as information about the specific members of a given population. The base-rate fallacy is thus the result of pitting what seem to be merely coincidental, therefore low-relevance, base rates against more specific, or causal, information. A series of probabilistic inference problems is presented in which relevance was manipulated with the means described above, and the empirical results confirm the above account. In particular, base rates will be combined with other information when the two kinds of information are perceived as being equally relevant to the judged case.},

In the second edition, accordingly, that short chapter was expanded into two chapters, each twice as long as the original. Section 23 (``Metaphysical Hypotheses about the Nature of Mind'') is an expanded treatment of the topics included in paragraphs 3{\textendash}7 of the earlier statement. Errors that had been committed in stating the views of Descartes and Leibniz were corrected by substituting for their names, at the appropriate places, ``the Cartesians'' and ``followers of Leibniz.'' Unguarded references to interaction (Wechselwirkung) of body and mind were not eliminated from this chapter.},

	shorttitle = {The use of self-quantification systems for personal health information},
	abstract = {Background
Self-quantification is seen as an emerging paradigm for health care self-management. Self-quantification systems ({SQS}) can be used for tracking, monitoring, and quantifying health aspects including mental, emotional, physical, and social aspects in order to gain self-knowledge. However, there has been a lack of a systematic approach for conceptualising and mapping the essential activities that are undertaken by individuals who are using {SQS} in order to improve health outcomes., In this paper, we propose a new model of personal health information self-quantification systems ({PHI}-{SQS}). {PHI}-{SQS} model describes two types of activities that individuals go through during their journey of health self-managed practice, which are 'self-quantification' and 'self-activation'.

Objectives
In this paper, we aimed to examine thoroughly the first type of activity in {PHI}-{SQS} which is 'self-quantification'. Our objectives were to review the data management processes currently supported in a representative set of self-quantification tools and ancillary applications, and provide a systematic approach for conceptualising and mapping these processes with the individuals' activities.

Method
We reviewed and compared eleven self-quantification tools and applications (Zeo Sleep Manager, Fitbit, Actipressure, {MoodPanda}, {iBGStar}, Sensaris Senspod, 23andMe, {uBiome}, Digifit, {BodyTrack}, and Wikilife), that collect three key health data types (Environmental exposure, Physiological patterns, Genetic traits). We investigated the interaction taking place at different data flow stages between the individual user and the self-quantification technology used.

Findings
We found that these eleven self-quantification tools and applications represent two major tool types (primary and secondary self-quantification systems). In each type, the individuals experience different processes and activities which are substantially influenced by the technologies' data management capabilities.

Conclusions
Self-quantification in personal health maintenance appears promising and exciting. However, more studies are needed to support its use in this field. The proposed model will in the future lead to developing a measure for assessing the effectiveness of interventions to support using {SQS} for health self-management (e.g., assessing the complexity of self-quantification activities, and activation of the individuals).},

	shorttitle = {Mobile health {IT}},
	abstract = {Background
Introducing computers into primary care can have negative effects on the doctor–patient dialogue. Little is known about such effects of mobile health {IT} in point-of-care situations.
Aim
To assess how different mobile information devices used by physicians in point-of-care situations support or hinder aspects of doctor–patient communication, such as face-to-face dialogue, nonverbal communication, and action transparency.
Method
The study draws on two different experimental simulation studies where 22 doctors, in 80 simulated ward rounds, accessed patient-related information from a paper chart, a {PDA}, and a laptop mounted on a trolley. Video recordings from the simulations were analyzed qualitatively. Interviews with clinicians and patients were used to triangulate the findings and to verify the realism and results of the simulations.
Result
The paper chart afforded smooth re-establishment of eye contact, better verbal and non-verbal contact, more gesturing, good visibility of actions, and quick information retrieval. The digital information devices lacked many of these affordances; physicians’ actions were not visible for the patients, the user interfaces required much attention, gesturing was harder, and re-establishment of eye contact took more time. Physicians used the devices to display their actions to the patients. The analysis revealed that the findings were related to the user interface and form factor of the information devices, as well as the personal characteristics of the physician.
Conclusion
When information is needed and has to be located at the point-of-care, the user interface and the physical form factor of the mobile information device are influential elements for successful collaboration between doctors and patients. Both elements need to be carefully designed so that physicians can use the devices to support face-to-face dialogue, nonverbal communication, and action visibility. The ability to facilitate and support the doctor–patient collaboration is a noteworthy usability factor in the design of mobile {EPR} systems. The paper also presents possible design guidelines for mobile point-of-care systems for improved doctor–patient communication.},

	shorttitle = {The Invisible Work of Personal Health Information Management Among People With Multiple Chronic Conditions},
	abstract = {Background
A critical problem for patients with chronic conditions who see multiple health care providers is incomplete or inaccurate information, which can contribute to lack of care coordination, low quality of care, and medical errors.

Objective
As part of a larger project on applications of consumer health information technology ({HIT}) and barriers to its use, we conducted a semistructured interview study with patients with multiple chronic conditions ({MCC}) with the objective of exploring their role in managing their personal health information.

Methods
Semistructured interviews were conducted with patients and providers. Patients were eligible if they had multiple chronic conditions and were in regular care with one of two medical organizations in New York City; health care providers were eligible if they had experience caring for patients with multiple chronic conditions. Analysis was conducted from a grounded theory perspective, and recruitment was concluded when saturation was achieved.

Results
A total of 22 patients and 7 providers were interviewed; patients had an average of 3.5 ({SD} 1.5) chronic conditions and reported having regular relationships with an average of 5 providers. Four major themes arose: (1) Responsibility for managing medical information: some patients perceived information management and sharing as the responsibility of health care providers; others—particularly those who had had bad experiences in the past—took primary responsibility for information sharing; (2) What information should be shared: although privacy concerns did influence some patients’ perceptions of sharing of medical data, decisions about what to share were also heavily influenced by their understanding of health and disease and by the degree to which they understood the health care system; (3) Methods and tools varied: those patients who did take an active role in managing their records used a variety of electronic tools, paper tools, and memory; and (4) Information management as invisible work: managing transfers of medical information to solve problems was a tremendous amount of work that was largely unrecognized by the medical establishment.

Conclusions
We conclude that personal health information management should be recognized as an additional burden that {MCC} places upon patients. Effective structural solutions for information sharing, whether institutional ones such as care management or technological ones such as electronic health information exchange, are likely not only to improve the quality of information shared but reduce the burden on patients already weighed down by {MCC}.},

Expectations range from overcoming structural barriers to access in low-income countries to more effective, interactive treatment of chronic conditions. Before medical health practice supported by mobile devices ("{mHealth}") can scale up, a number of challenges need to be adequately addressed. From a psychological perspective, high attrition rates, digital divide of society, and intellectual capabilities of the users are key issues when implementing such technologies. Furthermore, apps addressing behavior change often lack a comprehensive concept, which is essential for an ongoing impact. From a clinical point of view, there is insufficient evidence to allow scaling up of {mHealth} interventions. In addition, new concepts are required to assess the efficacy and efficiency of interventions. Regarding technology interoperability, open standards and low-energy wireless protocols appear to be vital for successful implementation. There is an ongoing discussion in how far health care-related apps require a conformity assessment and how to best communicate quality standards to consumers. "Apps Peer-Review" and standard reporting via an "App synopsis" appear to be promising approaches to increase transparency for end users. With respect to development, more emphasis must be placed on context analysis to identify what generic functions of mobile information technology best meet the needs of stakeholders involved. Hence, interdisciplinary alliances and collaborative strategies are vital to achieve sustainable growth for "{mHealth} 2.0," the next generation mobile technology to support patient care.},

As a result, patients may feel disengaged and disregarded. In this study, we examined the impact of using "Computer-on-Wheels" ({COWs}) in exam-rooms. We found physicians constantly reorienting and resituating exam-room computers to different positions during the three stages of a medical visit: communication-intensive phase, lecturing phase and ordering phase. We refer to this behavior as micro-negotiation of computer-use. Analysis of its usage patterns, as well as physician and patient perceptions, show that micro-negotiations facilitate eye contact expression and encourage patient participation in medical visits. In addition, we identify two tensions and two unintended benefits resulting from micro-negotiations. These findings lead us to consider new modes of negotiation in the exam-room that could alleviate the tensions identified while enabling physicians to continue enjoying micro-negotiation benefits in their work practice.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The quantified self, self-monitoring or life-logging movement is a trend to incorporate technology into data acquisition on aspects of a person's daily life in terms of inputs (eg food consumed), states (eg mood), and performance (mental and physical). Consumer self-monitoring mobile phone apps have been widely studied and used to promote healthy behavior changes. Data collected through life-logging apps also have the potential to support clinical care.
{OBJECTIVE}: We sought to develop an in-depth understanding of providers' facilitators and barriers to successfully integrating life-log data into their practices and creating better experiences. We specifically investigated three research questions: How do providers currently use patient-collected life-log data in clinical practice? What are provider concerns and needs with respect to this data? What are the constraints for providers to integrate this type of data into their workflows?
{METHODS}: We interviewed 21 health care providers-physicians, dietitians, a nurse practitioner, and a behavioral psychologist-who work with obese and irritable bowel syndrome patients. We transcribed and analyzed interviews according to thematic analysis and an affinity diagramming process.
{RESULTS}: Providers reported using self-monitoring data to enhance provider-patient communication, develop personalized treatment plans, and to motivate and educate patients, in addition to using them as diagnostic and adherence tools. However, limitations associated with current systems and workflows create barriers to regular and effective review of this data. These barriers include a lack of time to review detailed records, questions about providers' expertise to review it, and skepticism about additional benefits offered by reviewing data. Current self-monitoring tools also often lack flexibility, standardized formats, and mechanisms to share data with providers.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Variations in provider needs affect tracking and reviewing needs. Systems to support diagnosis might require better reliability and resolution, while systems to support interaction should support collaborative reflection and communication. Automatic synthesis of data logs could help providers focus on educational goals while communication of contextual information might help providers better understand patient values. We also discuss how current mobile apps and provider systems do, and do not, support these goals, and future design opportunities to realize the potential benefits of using life-logging tools in clinical care.},

	abstract = {Objective: Gait disturbances like shuffling and short steps are obvious at visual observation in patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease ({PD}). However, quantitative methods are increasingly used to evaluate the wide range of gait abnormalities that may occur over the disease course. The goal of this study was to test the ability of a trunk accelerometer system to quantify the effects of {PD} on several gait features when walking at self-selected speed. Methods: We recruited 96 subjects split into three age-matched groups: 32 healthy controls ({HC}), 32 {PD} patients at Hoehn and Yahr stage {\textless} {II} ({PD}-1), and 32 patients at Hoehn \& Yahr stage {II}-{III} ({PD}-2). The following outcomes were extracted from the signals of the tri-axial accelerometer worn on the lower back: stride length, cadence, regularity index, symmetry index and mechanical powers yielded in the cranial-caudal, antero-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Walking speed was measured using a stopwatch. Results: beside other gait features, the {PD}-1 and the {PD}-2 groups showed significantly reduced stride length normalized to height (p{\textless}0.02) and symmetry index (p{\textless}0.009) in comparison to the {HC}. Regularity index was the only feature significantly decreased in the {PD}-2 group as compared with the two other groups (p{\textless}0.01). The clinical relevance of this finding was supported by significant correlations with mobility and gait scales (r is around -0.3; p{\textless}0.05). Conclusion: Gait quantified by a trunk accelerometer may provide clinically useful information for the screening and follow-up of {PD} patients.},

Design and Methods:  Longitudinal, qualitative study using videotapes of regularly scheduled visits from 3 points in time: 1 month before, 1 month after, and 7 months after introduction of computers into the exam room. Setting:  Primary care medical clinic in a large integrated delivery system. Participants:  Nine clinicians (6 physicians, 2 physician assistants, and 1 nurse practitioner) and 54 patients. Results:  The introduction of computers into the exam room affected the visual, verbal, and postural connection between clinicians and patients. There were variations across the visits in the magnitude and direction of the computer's effect. We identified 4 domains in which exam-room computing affected clinician–patient communication: visit organization, verbal and nonverbal behavior, computer navigation and mastery, and spatial organization of the exam room. We observed a range of facilitating and inhibiting effects on clinician–patient communication in all 4 domains. For 2 domains, visit organization and verbal and nonverbal behavior, facilitating and inhibiting behaviors observed prior to the introduction of the computer appeared to be amplified when exam-room computing occurred. Likewise, exam-room computing involving navigation and mastery skills and spatial organization of the exam-room created communication challenges and opportunities. In all 4 domains, there was little change observed in exam-room computing behaviors from the point of introduction to 7-month follow-up. Conclusions:  Effective use of computers in the outpatient exam room may be dependent upon clinicians' baseline skills that are carried forward and are amplified, positively or negatively, in their effects on clinician–patient communication. Computer use behaviors do not appear to change much over the first 7 months. Administrators and educators interested in improving exam-room computer use by clinicians need to better understand clinician skills and previous work habits associated with electronic medical records. More study of the effects of new technologies on the clinical relationship is also needed.},

	abstract = {Aim

Few real-life studies of non-severe (self-treated) hypoglycaemic events are available. This survey quantified the self-reported frequency of non-severe hypoglycaemia and its effects in adults with insulin-treated diabetes in the {UK}.


Methods

Adults aged {\textgreater} 15 years with Type 1 diabetes or insulin-treated Type 2 diabetes completed ≤ 4 weekly questionnaires (7–day recall). Respondents with Type 2 diabetes were grouped by insulin regimen: basal-only, basal–bolus and ‘other’.


Results

Overall, 1038 respondents (466 with Type 1 diabetes, 572 with Type 2 diabetes) completed 3528 questionnaires. Mean numbers of non-severe events per week were 2.4 (Type 1 diabetes; median = 2) and 0.8 (Type 2 diabetes; median = 0); 23\% and 26\% of non-severe events occurred at night, respectively. Fatigue and reduced alertness were the commonest issues following events (78\% and 51\% of respondents, respectively). The effects of nocturnal events persisted longer than those of daytime events: Type 1 diabetes = 10.6 vs. 4.9 h (P = 0.0002); Type 2 diabetes = 15.3 vs. 5.1 h (P {\textless} 0.0001). In the week following an event, respondents’ blood glucose measurements increased by 4.3 (Type 1 diabetes; 12\% increment) and 4.2 (Type 2 diabetes; 21\% increment) tests/week. In employed respondents, 20\% of events caused work-time loss, more so following nocturnal (vs. daytime) hypoglycaemia: Type 1 diabetes = 2.7 vs. 1.1 h (P = 0.0184); Type 2 diabetes = 2.5 vs. 1.6 h (P = 0.1340). Most respondents rarely/never informed healthcare professionals about events (Type 1 diabetes = 82\%, Type 2 diabetes = 69\%).


Conclusions

Non-severe hypoglycaemia is common in adults with insulin-treated diabetes in the {UK}, with consequent health-related/economic effects. Communication about non-severe hypoglycaemia is limited and the burden of hypoglycaemia may be underestimated.},

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ({HNSCC}) is strongly associated with tobacco use. We sought to examine the relationship between self-reported tobacco use and the level of urinary tobacco carcinogen metabolites in a cohort of patients with {HNSCC}.


Study Design

Cross-sectional analysis.


Methods

Eighty-four cigarette smokers with head and neck cancer completed tobacco and alcohol use questionnaires, and the following urinary tobacco metabolites were quantified: 1-hydroxypyrene (1-{HOP}), N'-nitrosonornicotine and its glucuronides (total {NNN}), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol and its glucuronides (total {NNAL}), and cotinine. A cross-sectional analysis was performed with assessment of correlation coefficients.


Results

When analyzed based on self-reported cigarettes per day ({CPD}), no significant correlation with any of the studied tobacco carcinogen metabolites was found. However, urinary cotinine showed significant correlation with total {NNN}, total {NNAL}, and 1-{HOP}. Total {NNN}, total {NNAL}, and 1-{HOP} showed significant correlation with each other suggesting exposure occurs to each proportionally.


Conclusions

In smokers with {HNSCC}, self-reported tobacco use does not predict actual carcinogen exposure. In contrast, urinary cotinine levels significantly correlate with carcinogen levels. Therefore, urinary cotinine is the preferred value for estimating carcinogen dose in these patients. 1-{HOP} levels were significantly associated with total {NNN} and total {NNAL} suggesting that smokers are exposed to these carcinogens proportionally. These data indicate that utilizing conventional methods of estimating tobacco exposure ({CPD}) may not accurately approximate exposure to tobacco carcinogens in smokers with {HNSCC}. These data have implications for future studies focused on screening and epidemiology of smokers with {HNSCC}.

To understand potential benefits of such tools, we studied the tracking behaviors of 25 women with breast cancer. We provided 10 of these participants with a real-time tracking tool that served as a “technology probe” to uncover behaviors and benefits from voluntary use. Our findings showed that while patients’ tracking behaviors without a tool were fragmented and sporadic, these behaviors with a tool were more consistent. Participants also used tracked data to see patterns among symptoms, feel psychosocial comfort, and improve symptom communication with clinicians. We conclude with design implications for future real-time tracking tools.},

Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center now faces the challenge of bridging the technology gap between such systems and the Internet. While developing Web interfaces to legacy clinical systems gives a taste of the future, it is clear that complete institutional migration to the Web is not imminent. Asking clinicians to utilize two different systems, Web-based and legacy, in the interim phase is just one of the difficulties in such transition. This paper describes "Mbridge", a solution that allows legacy system users to exploit the benefits of the Internet in a fashion that does not interfere with their workflow and is both simple and affordable to implement. The service allows clinicians to work on the legacy platform while context-sensitive clinical content is streamed to the browser without their intervention. Using the system, we can gradually expose clinicians to new Web-based applications and resources without forcing them to operate two computing environments simultaneously. The service achieves these goals by means of linkage and coordination rather than by code-translation, data exchange or replication.},

	abstract = {Background
A tantalizing question in medical informatics is how to construct knowledge from heterogeneous datasets, and as an extension, inform clinical decisions. The emergence of large-scale data integration in electronic health records ({EHR}) presents tremendous opportunities. However, our ability to efficiently extract informed decision support is limited due to the complexity of the clinical states and decision process, missing data and lack of analytical tools to advice based on statistical relationships.

Objective
Development and assessment of a data-driven method that infers the probability distribution of the current state of patients with sepsis, likely trajectories, optimal actions related to antibiotic administration, prediction of mortality and length-of-stay.

Methods
We present a data-driven, probabilistic framework for clinical decision support in sepsis-related cases. We first define states, actions, observations and rewards based on clinical practice, expert knowledge and data representations in an {EHR} dataset of 1492 patients. We then use Partially Observable Markov Decision Process ({POMDP}) model to derive the optimal policy based on individual patient trajectories and we evaluate the performance of the model-derived policies in a separate test set. Policy decisions were focused on the type of antibiotic combinations to administer. Multi-class and discriminative classifiers were used to predict mortality and length of stay.

Results
Data-derived antibiotic administration policies led to a favorable patient outcome in 49\% of the cases, versus 37\% when the alternative policies were followed (P=1.3e-13). Sensitivity analysis on the model parameters and missing data argue for a highly robust decision support tool that withstands parameter variation and data uncertainty. When the optimal policy was followed, 387 patients (25.9\%) have 90\% of their transitions to better states and 503 patients (33.7\%) patients had 90\% of their transitions to worse states (P=4.0e-06), while in the non-policy cases, these numbers are 192 (12.9\%) and 764 (51.2\%) patients (P=4.6e-117), respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of transitions within a trajectory that lead to a better or better/same state are significantly higher by following the policy than for non-policy cases (605 vs 344 patients, P=8.6e-25). Mortality was predicted with an {AUC} of 0.7 and 0.82 accuracy in the general case and similar performance was obtained for the inference of the length-of-stay ({AUC} of 0.69 to 0.73 with accuracies from 0.69 to 0.82).

Conclusions
A data-driven model was able to suggest favorable actions, predict mortality and length of stay with high accuracy. This work provides a solid basis for a scalable probabilistic clinical decision support framework for sepsis treatment that can be expanded to other clinically relevant states and actions, as well as a data-driven model that can be adopted in other clinical areas with sufficient training data.},
